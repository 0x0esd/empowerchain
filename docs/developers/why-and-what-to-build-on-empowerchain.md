# Why and what to build on EmpowerChain

EmpowerChain is a decentralized application platform focused on the circular economy, recycling, and waste management.
There are no absolute limits to what you can build on EmpowerChain. Still, the initial goals are to develop tools and applications that either leverage core applications (like marketplaces, DeFi, etc.) or create new applications that help solve circular economy problems.

## Why build on EmpowerChain?

There are many places to build, so what makes EmpowerChain worth building on?
Mainly, the reason is to get the best place to build circular economy applications.
These applications are not always easy to build, but that is also precisely why they are worth building (if they were easy, anybody could do it).

Some of the benefits include:
- The ability to leverage the users base of EmpowerChain
- The ability to leverage the existing applications of EmpowerChain
- Building on a platform that is focused on solving the problems of circular economy and is backed and supported by a company that concentrates entirely on this
- Building alongside like-minded people
- Fee and revenue sharing
- Grant programs

The exact details of all these are being worked out, but we will share more information as we go.
We want to build out these details with _you_ so please reach out to chat.

## What to build on EmpowerChain?

We don't have all the answers, but we have some ideas.

To give you some examples of applications that could be built (but we also expect there to be many others we have not envisioned):
- Plastic Credit DeFi applications (marketplaces, lending, etc.)
- Green stable currencies: like DAI, but backed by renewable energy production
- Waste Management and Recycling Apps: Developers can create applications to facilitate waste collection, sorting, and recycling, connecting waste generators with recyclers and waste management companies.
- Environmental Impact Tracking: Applications that help individuals and businesses track their environmental impacts, such as carbon footprint, plastic usage, and waste production, and suggest ways to reduce them.
- Marketplaces for Recycled Materials: Platforms that connect buyers and sellers of recycled materials, making it easier to find and trade sustainably sourced products and materials.
- Supply Chain Traceability: Solutions that improve the traceability of products and materials throughout their lifecycle, from production to end-of-life, ensuring transparency and accountability in the circular economy.
- Incentive and Reward Programs: Applications that encourage and reward sustainable behavior, such as recycling, waste reduction, and responsible consumption, using token-based incentives or other mechanisms.
- Eco-friendly Product Certification: Platforms that verify and certify products based on their sustainability, recyclability, and environmental impact, helping consumers make informed choices.
- Crowdfunding for Environmental Projects: Applications that enable individuals and organizations to support environmental projects, like clean-up initiatives, recycling programs, or green infrastructure development, through crowdfunding and token-based contributions.
- Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Solutions: DeFi applications tailored to the circular economy, such as green bonds, sustainability-linked loans, or investment products that support environmentally responsible projects and businesses.

We won't try to limit application development or use cases. Still, we will focus on applications that help solve the problems of circular economy (either directly or by extending/supporting other applications).
