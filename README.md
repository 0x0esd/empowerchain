# EmpowerChain

This is where the code for EmpowerChain is located. Documentation is being built right now.

In the meantime, take a look at our [whitepaper](https://github.com/empowerchain/empowerchain/blob/main/Whitepaper.pdf), [website](https://empowerchain.io) and [@empowerchain_io on twitter](https://twitter.com/empowerchain_io).


# Development

## Get started

```
ignite chain serve
```

`serve` command installs dependencies, builds, initializes, and starts your blockchain in development.

### Configure

Your blockchain in development can be configured with `config.yml`. To learn more, see the [Ignite CLI docs](https://docs.ignite.com).

## Release
To release a new version of your blockchain, create and push a new tag with `v` prefix. A new draft release with the configured targets will be created.

```
git tag v0.1
git push origin v0.1
```

After a draft release is created, make your final changes from the release page and publish it.

### Install
To install the latest version of your blockchain node's binary, execute the following command on your machine:

```
curl https://get.ignite.com/empowerchain/empowerchain@latest! | sudo bash
```
`empowerchain/empowerchain` should match the `username` and `repo_name` of the Github repository to which the source code was pushed. Learn more about [the install process](https://github.com/allinbits/starport-installer).
